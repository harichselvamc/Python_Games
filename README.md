>If the user's answer is incorrect, an "incorrect" message is displayed.
>After answering all the questions, the user's score is displayed.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Text-based):

>The program initializes a list representing the game field and a variable for the current player.
>The program defines functions for drawing the game field, ending the game, and checking for a win condition.
>The program prompts the players to make moves by entering the position they want to mark.
>The program switches players and checks for a win condition after each move.
>The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.


# Hangman Game (GUI):

>The program imports the necessary modules (including tkinter for GUI elements) and sets up the main window.
>It loads a series of hangman images.
>The program selects a word and converts it to lowercase.
>The user is prompted to guess a letter.
>If the guessed letter is in the word, a success message is displayed, and the letter is removed from the word.
>If the guessed letter is not in the word, a "wrong" message is displayed, and the hangman image changes.
>The game continues until the user either guesses all the letters or exceeds the maximum number of tries.

# Tic-Tac-Toe Game (GUI):

>The program imports the necessary modules and sets up the main window.
>It defines a function for handling button clicks in the game.
>The program initializes a list representing the game field, creates buttons for each position, and associates the button click function with them.
>It defines functions for ending the game and checking for a win condition.
>The game continues until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
